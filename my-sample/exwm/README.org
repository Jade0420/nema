* EXWM config sample
** Files
*** =exwm_start=
    Copy =exwm_start= in your global PATH (i.e. =/usr/local/bin/=) and =chmod 755= it. It acts like =.xinitrc=.

    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    If you're using Arch/Manjaro, you may need to =pacman -S xorg-xhost= to eliminate "No protocol specified" error.
    #+END_QUOTE
*** =exwm.desktop=
    Copy =exwm.desktop= in =/usr/share/xsessions/= (for Arch/Manjaro?) or =/usr/local/xsessions/= (for Ubuntu/Debian?).

    Now you can find "EXWM" option in your login screen (DM).
*** =exwm.el=
    You can copy or symlink =exwm.el= into your =.emacs.d/my/=.
** Known issues
*** Starting takes tooo much time
    Because the exwm loading process is in the last part of my =init.el=. You can raise this process manually if necessary.

    For example, =(require)= it immediately after =nema-basic=.
