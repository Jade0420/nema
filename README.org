* Customize
  There are many ways to hack this. You can
  1. Fork me, then modify the =.emacs.d/nema/*.el= files (it's yours!), or
  2. Write your ELisp in =.emacs.d/my/*.el=. They will be loaded after all =nema-*= modules are loaded.
     - Your snippets will be saved and loaded in =.emacs.d/my/snippets/**/*=. See =nema-snippet.el= for more
       information.
     - =.emacs.d/my/**/*= is in =.gitignore= list. So you can save sensitive data
       (i.e. IRC login info or Mail account) or some machine-specific configs (i.e. if you have a HiDPI laptop
       and a workstation with normal DPI displays) without syncing across with =git=.


* Known issues
  1. If it is run at its first time, make sure not to use =emacs --server=, since it may prompt you
     of Elisp-enabled themes. Use =emacs= or =emacs -nw= instead, and press =y= if prompted.
     When =.emacs.d/custom.el= is built, you can use server mode without problem.
