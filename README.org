* Customize
  There are many ways to hack this. You can
  1. Fork me, then modify the =.emacs.d/nema/*.el= files (it's yours!), or
  2. Write your ELisp in =.emacs.d/my/*.el=. They will be loaded after all =nema-*= modules are loaded.
     - Your snippets will be saved and loaded in =.emacs.d/my/snippets/**/*=. See =nema-snippet.el= for more
       information.
     - =.emacs.d/my/**/*= is in =.gitignore= list. So you can save sensitive data
       (e.g. IRC login info or Mail account) or some machine-specific configs (e.g. if you have a HiDPI laptop
       and a workstation with normal DPI displays) without syncing across with =git=.

* Known issues
  1. If it is run at its first time, make sure not to use =emacs --server=, since it may prompt you
     of Elisp-enabled themes. Use =emacs= or =emacs -nw= instead, and press =y= if prompted.
     When =.emacs.d/custom.el= is built, you can use server mode without problem.

* TODOs [0/2]
** TODO [2/3] Sample =my/= configs for:
   - [X] EXWM
   - [X] erc
   - [ ] WanderLust
** TODO =.spacemacs=-like external config file
   So that enable/disable layers might be easier and may avoid touching this git repo.
   Wait do I really need this?
